# Project Vision – Clothes Renting Platform

## Project Overview
This project is an online clothes renting platform that allows users to rent fashionable clothing for short-term use instead of purchasing them. The platform focuses on affordability, sustainability, and convenience by enabling users to access a wide range of outfits for occasions such as parties, weddings, and formal events.

## Problem It Solves
Buying clothes for occasional use is expensive, space-consuming, and environmentally unsustainable. Many users wear such clothes only once or twice. This platform reduces unnecessary purchases by providing a rental-based alternative that saves money and promotes sustainable fashion.

## Target Users (Personas)
- College students looking for affordable fashion options  
- Young professionals renting outfits for events  
- Users interested in sustainable and eco-friendly fashion  
- Fashion-conscious individuals who prefer variety without ownership  

## Vision Statement
To create a reliable and user-friendly clothing rental platform that makes fashion accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone.

## Key Features / Goals
